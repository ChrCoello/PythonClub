    "Though there are various ways to install Python, the one I would suggest – particularly if you wish to eventually use the data science tools mentioned above – is via the cross-platform Anaconda distribution which is accessible through the [Software Centre](https://kiosk.uio.no/) at UiO.\n",
    "[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) includes both Python and ``conda``, and additionally bundles a suite of other pre-installed packages geared toward scientific computing.\n",
    "Any others package not included with Anaconda distribution can also be installed manually on top. For example if your want to install the IPython notebook package:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[~]$ conda install ipython-notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "For more information on ``conda``, including information about creating and using conda environments, refer to the Anaconda package documentation linked at the above page.\n",
    "\n",
    "In term of version, the newest version is 3.6 and I would recommend to start learning Python 3 instead of PYthon 2. But some packages are only availble in Python 2. In some cases, you might have to install both in parallel. "
